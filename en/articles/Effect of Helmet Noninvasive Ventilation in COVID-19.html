Failure: The HENIVOT Randomized Clinical Trial</h1><p>Grieco DL, Menga LS, Cesarano M, et al. Effect of Helmet Noninvasive Ventilation vs High-Flow Nasal Oxygen on Days Free of Respiratory Support in Patients With COVID-19 and Moderate to Severe Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The HENIVOT Randomized Clinical Trial. <em>JAMA.</em> Published online March 25, 2021. doi:10.1001/jama.2021.4682</p><p>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778088</p><p>Key Points</p><p><strong>Question</strong> Among patients admitted to the intensive care unit with COVID-19–induced moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, does early continuous treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation increase the number of days free of respiratory support at 28 days as compared with high-flow nasal oxygen?</p><p><strong>Findings</strong> In this randomized trial that included 109 patients, the median number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days was 20 days in the group that received helmet noninvasive ventilation and 18 days in the group that received high-flow nasal oxygen, a difference that was not statistically significant.</p><p><strong>Meaning</strong> Among critically ill patients with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19, helmet noninvasive ventilation, compared with high-flow nasal oxygen, resulted in no significant difference in the number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days.</p><p>Abstract</p><p><strong>Importance</strong> High-flow nasal oxygen is recommended as initial treatment for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and is widely applied in patients with COVID-19.</p><p><strong>Objective</strong> To assess whether helmet noninvasive ventilation can increase the days free of respiratory support in patients with COVID-19 compared with high-flow nasal oxygen alone.</p><p><strong>Design, Setting, and Participants</strong> Multicenter randomized clinical trial in 4 intensive care units (ICUs) in Italy between October and December 2020, end of follow-up February 11, 2021, including 109 patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure (ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ≤200).</p><p><strong>Interventions</strong> Participants were randomly assigned to receive continuous treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation (positive end-expiratory pressure, 10-12 cm H2O; pressure support, 10-12 cm H2O) for at least 48 hours eventually followed by high-flow nasal oxygen (n = 54) or high-flow oxygen alone (60 L/min) (n = 55).</p><p><strong>Main Outcomes and Measures</strong> The primary outcome was the number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients who required endotracheal intubation within 28 days from study enrollment, the number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation at day 28, the number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation at day 60, in-ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, 28-day mortality, 60-day mortality, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay.</p><p><strong>Results</strong> Among 110 patients who were randomized, 109 (99%) completed the trial (median age, 65 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 55-70]; 21 women [19%]). The median days free of respiratory support within 28 days after randomization were 20 (IQR, 0-25) in the helmet group and 18 (IQR, 0-22) in the high-flow nasal oxygen group, a difference that was not statistically significant (mean difference, 2 days [95% CI, −2 to 6]; <em>P</em> = .26). Of 9 prespecified secondary outcomes reported, 7 showed no significant difference. The rate of endotracheal intubation was significantly lower in the helmet group than in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (30% vs 51%; difference, −21% [95% CI, −38% to −3%]; <em>P</em> = .03). The median number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation within 28 days was significantly higher in the helmet group than in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (28 [IQR, 13-28] vs 25 [IQR 4-28]; mean difference, 3 days [95% CI, 0-7]; <em>P</em> = .04). The rate of in-hospital mortality was 24% in the helmet group and 25% in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (absolute difference, −1% [95% CI, −17% to 15%]; <em>P</em> &gt; .99).</p><p><strong>Conclusions and Relevance</strong> Among patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe hypoxemia, treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation, compared with high-flow nasal oxygen, resulted in no significant difference in the number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days. Further research is warranted to determine effects on other outcomes, including the need for endotracheal intubation.</p><p><strong>Trial Registration</strong> ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04502576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NCT04502576<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p>Introduction</p><p>The role of noninvasive respiratory support in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is debated.<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778088#joi210034r1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a> Noninvasive ventilation may help avoid endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation; however, the rate of treatment failure can be as high as 60%, and patients exposed to delayed intubation experience worse clinical outcome.<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778088#joi210034r2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a>-<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778088#joi210034r2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p>The uncertainty about the initial management of hypoxemic respiratory failure has been emphasized by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Comparisons between groups regarding qualitative variables were performed with the Fisher exact test. Intergroup differences in quantitative variables distribution in the initial 48 hours of treatment were assessed with analysis of variance.</p><p>Data on the endotracheal intubation were assessed both in terms of crude reintubation rate and after exclusion of patients for whom the decision to intubate was not deemed adherent to the criteria of the protocol by the external experts. Kaplan-Meier curves are displayed for results concerning intubation rate; the graphical representation showed no evidence against the assumption of proportionality. Post hoc analyses were conducted to establish the potential effect of covariates on the primary outcome measure and on the occurrence of endotracheal intubation. For this purpose, a mixed-effect modeling including site and time of enrollment as random effects and significant covariates (study group and all demographic variables showing association with the event endotracheal intubation with a <em>P</em> ≤ .05 at the bivariable analysis) as fixed effects was performed.</p><p>There were no missing data for the primary, secondary, and safety end points. There were missing data in the exploratory end points due to the occurrence of endotracheal intubation during the initial 48 hours. Because data were not missing at random but mainly due to the consequence of treatment effect, we did not perform multiple imputation and excluded missing values from analysis.</p><p>All results with 2-sided <em>P</em> ≤ .05 are considered statistically significant. Because of the potential for type I error due to multiple comparisons, findings from analyses on secondary end points should be interpreted as exploratory. Statistical analysis was performed with R Project for Statistical Computing (version 4.0.4).</p><p>Results</p><p>Between October 13 and December 13, 2020, a total of 182 patients were admitted to the 4 participating intensive care units due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; among 149 spontaneously breathing patients, 110 were eligible for inclusion in the study and underwent randomization (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778088#joi210034f2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figure 2<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a>).

ventilation at 28 days from randomization. These results indicate that noninvasive respiratory support with helmet noninvasive ventilation did not directly affect the disease process and the duration of the need for respiratory support, but enabled successful noninvasive management with avoidance of intubation in a greater proportion of patients.</p><p>The rate of endotracheal intubation during high-flow nasal oxygen in the cohort was

Monitoring of patients receiving noninvasive support during acute hypoxemic respiratory failure remains of paramount importance not to delay endotracheal intubation and protective ventilation.<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778088#joi210034r9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p>The study has several strengths: the randomized multicenter design with reproducible enrollment criteria, well-defined treatment protocols that can be applied in other intensive care units, strict prespecified criteria for defining the need for endotracheal intubation, and a process of external validation by 3 independent experts to verify the adherence to such criteria for intubated patients.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the limited sample could have made the study underpowered to detect small differences between groups in the primary end point. Second, helmet noninvasive ventilation has been applied continuously for at least 48 hours with high positive end-expiratory pressure and relatively low pressure support in centers with expertise with this technique. Use of this technique with different ventilator settings, with nonadequate personnel expertise, and/or in intermittent sessions may not provide the same benefits observed in our study. Third, the use of awake prone positioning was not standardized and occurred more frequently in patients in the high-flow nasal oxygen group, as per clinical decision: this does not alter, and could even strengthen, the significance of the results on endotracheal intubation because prone positioning could have optimized the perceived benefit by high-flow oxygen.<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778088#joi210034r18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a> Fourth, all enrolled patients were affected by COVID-19, and the results, despite being physiologically sound and consistent with the most recent literature on acute hypoxemic respiratory of other ethiologies,<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778088#joi210034r11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a> may not fully be generalizable to hypoxemic respiratory failure due to other causes.<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778088#joi210034r18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Among patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe hypoxemia, treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation, compared with high-flow nasal oxygen, resulted in no significant difference in the number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days.
